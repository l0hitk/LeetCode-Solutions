# 85. Maximal Rectangle
> Hard | Array | Dynamic Programming | Stack | Matrix | Monotonic Stack

Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

**Constraints**

    rows == matrix.length
    cols == matrix[i].length
    1 <= row, cols <= 200
    matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

**Example 1**

    Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.

**Example 2**

    Input: matrix = [["0"]]
    Output: 0

**Example 3**

    Input: matrix = [["1"]]
    Output: 1

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def maximalRectangle(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            return 0
        rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        heights = [0] * cols
        max_area = 0
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if matrix[i][j] == '1':
                    heights[j] += 1
                else:
                    heights[j] = 0
            stack = []
            heights.append(0)
            for k in range(len(heights)):
                while stack and heights[k] < heights[stack[-1]]:
                    height = heights[stack.pop()]
                    width = k if not stack else k - stack[-1] - 1
                    max_area = max(max_area, height * width)
                stack.append(k)
        return max_area
